Although manual interpretation of the PET image is more accurate and reproducible than thresholding-based semiautomatic segmentation methods, human contouring has large interobserver and intraobserver variations and moreover, it is extremely time-consuming. Further, it is harder for humans to analyze more than two dimensions at a time and it becomes even harder if multiple modalities are involved. Moreover, if the task is to analyze a series of images it quickly becomes an onerous job for a single human. The new statistical framework is designed to mimic the human perception for tumour delineation and marry it with all the advan- tages of an analytic method using modern day computing environment."

However, the three major challenges in radiology are: (1) increasing demand for medical imaging (2) decreasing turnaround times caused by mass data (3) diagnostic accuracy that leads to a quantification of images. To address these challenges along with ethical issues regarding the use of Artificial Intelligence in patient care, there is a need to develop a new framework of statistical analysis which can be readily used by clinicians and can be trained with a relatively lower number of samples. Most existing algorithms segments a 2D slice by assigning the grid of pixels into the tumour or non-tumour class. Instead of a pixel-level analysis, we will assume that the true intensity comes from a smooth underlying spatial process which can be modelled by a kernel estimates [2]. In this project, we have developed a kernel smoothing-based probability contour method on PET image segmentation, which provides a surface over images that produces contour-based results rather than pixel-wise results, thus mimicking human observers' behaviour. In addition, our methodology provides the tools for developing a probabilistic approach with uncertainty measurement along with the segmentation.

Cases aged  <16 years have since been identified in 35 countries.2 Here we report a detailed investigation of 9 early cases and 58 control subjects. Using next-generation sequencing and real-time PCR, adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2), was detected in the plasma of 9/9 and liver of 4/4 patients but in 0/13 sera/plasma of age-matched healthy controls, 0/12 children with adenovirus (HAdV) infection and normal liver function and 0/33 children admitted to hospital with hepatitis of other aetiology. AAV2 typically requires a coinfecting 'helper' virus to replicate, usually HAdV or a herpesvirus. HAdV (species C and F) and human herpesvirus 6B (HHV6B) were detected in 6/9 and 3/9 affected cases, including 3/4 and 2/4 liver biopsies, respectively. The class II HLA-DRB1*04:01 allele was identified in 8/9 cases (89%), compared with a background frequency of 15.6% in Scottish blood donors, suggestive of increased susceptibility in affected cases. Acute non-A-E paediatric hepatitis is associated with the presence of AAV2 infection, which could represent a primary pathogen or a useful biomarker of recent HAdV or HHV6B infection. Population and mechanistic studies are required to explore these findings further."

B.1.177/Alpha: 1st November 2020 - 30th January 2021 (n = 1640). Alpha/Delta: 1st April - 30th June 2021 (n = 5552). AY.4.2 Delta/non-AY.4.2 Delta: 1st July - 31st October 2021 (n = 9613). Non-AY.4.2 Delta/Omicron: 1st - 31st December 2021 (n = 3858).Main outcome measures Admission to hospital, ICU, or death within 28 days of positive COVID-19 testResults For B.1.177/Alpha, 300 of 807 B.1.177 cases were recorded as hospitalised or worse, compared to 232 of 833 Alpha cases. After adjustment, the cumulative odds ratio was 1.51 (95\% CI: 1.08-2.11) for Alpha versus B.1.177. For Alpha/Delta, 113 of 2104 Alpha cases were recorded as hospitalised or worse, compared to 230 of 3448 Delta cases.

After adjustment, the cumulative odds ratio was 0.99 (95\% CI: 0.76-1.27) for AY.4.2 Delta versus non-AY.4.2 Delta. For non-AY.4.2 Delta/Omicron, 30 of 1164 non-AY.4.2 Delta cases were recorded as hospitalised or worse, compared to 26 of 2694 Omicron cases. After adjustment, the median cumulative odds ratio was 0.49 (95\% CI: 0.22-1.06) for Omicron versus non-AY.4.2 Delta.Conclusions The direction of change in disease severity between successively emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern was inconsistent.
