> Functional data analysis is a growing field of research and has been employed in a wide range of applications ranging from genetics in biology to stock markets in economics. A crucial but challenging problem is clustering of functional data. In this thesis, we review the main contributions in this field and discuss the strengthens and weaknesses of the different clustering functional data approaches. We propose a new framework for clustering functional data and a new paradigm for model selection that is specifically designed for functional data, which are designed to address many of the weaknesses of existing techniques.
