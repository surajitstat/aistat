description: Vaccines based on the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 are a cornerstone of the public health response to COVID-19. The emergence of hypermutated, increasingly transmissible variants of concern (VOCs) threaten this strategy. We study the real-world vaccine effectiveness of Oxford/AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1), Pfizer BioNTech (BNT162b2)  and Moderna (mRNA-1273). that was partially restored along with the effectiveness of  booster vaccination.
