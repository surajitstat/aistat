## Leading VKEMS activities

**29th - 31st March 2022** \- [Recovery from the Pandemic: Transport Logistics](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgateway.newton.ac.uk%2Fevent%2Ftgm112&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0C-rjcKj4UAJhWZr_hIKqS) – Virtual Study Group

This three-day virtual study group aims to bring mathematical scientists and other disciplines together to solve end user defined challenges with the aim of mitigating the impact of COVID-19, climate change and the change of regulations on the shipping and supply chain network.

Since the event, participants have collaborated to develop a [working paper](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgateway.newton.ac.uk%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fasset%2Fdoc%2F2208%2FTransport%2520Logistics%2520Virtual%2520Study%2520Group%2520Report.pdf&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0ZiwjmDoGBjHIZtCnTL8cY).

**12th - 14th October 2021** \- [Recovery from the Pandemic: Hospitality & Leisure](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgateway.newton.ac.uk%2Fevent%2Ftgm105&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0rZjg9q13HfN8g3jwO6aOo) – Virtual Study Group

This three-day [virtual study group](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgateway.newton.ac.uk%2Fevent%2Ftgm105&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0rZjg9q13HfN8g3jwO6aOo) brought mathematical scientists and other disciplines together to solve challenges faced by the hospitality and leisure sector as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The UK leisure industry as a whole has met some unprecedented challenges over the course of the pandemic, and will continue to do so as the nation recovers. We are interested in using mathematics as a tool to help solve the particular challenges hotels, restaurants and leisure facilities, such as cinemas, gyms and museums, are facing as a result of the pandemic.

Unlike in previous study groups where the main focus was on modelling the spread of the infection, the theme of this event was about recovery from the pandemic with more of a focus on dealing with the operational difficulties and economic implications which have arisen. This event brought mathematical scientists and other disciplines together to solve end user defined challenges with the aim of mitigating the impact of COVID-19 on the hospitality and leisure sector.

Since the event, participants have collaborated to develop a [working paper](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgateway.newton.ac.uk%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fasset%2Fdoc%2F2201%2FHospitality%2520and%2520Leisure%2520Virtual%2520Study%2520Group%2520Report.pdf&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2gX2ngOlf34v47joUl38Kq) and the AIRBODS Researchers have shared a [blog post](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fairbods.org.uk%2Fblog%2Fgateway-blog%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2YUESRejocbThZCss2BIpB) about their participation. Abbie Marsh, a Summer Research Intern at University of Bath, was granted a Santander Scholarship to follow up the study group work with Shakespeare's Globe and compiled this [poster report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/139yRTjohTfBiQRbiN2LVb6Ucc9RX7b2t/view?usp=sharing) with the findings.
