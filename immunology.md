Pattern discovery in sequences is an important unsolved problem in biology, with many applications, including detecting regulation of genes by transcription factors, and differentiating proteins of infecting organisms such as viruses from an animalâ€™s own genome. Our work describe some of the recent statistical approaches developed to address these problems, and some possible future directions for progress in this field.


In particular, protein antigens and their specific epitopes are formulation targets for epitope-based vaccines.  In 2008, a number of prediction servers were available for identification of peptides that bind major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules. The lack of standardized methodology and large number of human MHC-I molecules made the selection of appropriate prediction servers difficult. Our work reported a comparative evaluation of thirty prediction servers for seven human MHC-I molecules. This work has been heavily cited since its publication.
